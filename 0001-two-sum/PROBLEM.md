## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly* one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

## Constraints

- 2 &le; nums.length &le; 10<sup>4</sup>
- -10<sup>9</sup> &le; nums[i] &le; 10<sup>9</sup>
- -10<sup>9</sup> &le; target &le; 10<sup>9</sup>
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

 ## Follow-up
 Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than O(n<sup>2</sup>) time complexity?
