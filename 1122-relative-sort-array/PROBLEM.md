## Description

Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the elements of `arr2` are distinct, and all elements in `arr2` are also in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in **ascending** order.

## Constraints

- 1 &le; arr1.length, arr2.length &le; 1000
- 0 &le; arr1[i], arr2[i] &le; 1000
- All the elements of `arr2` are **distinct**.
- Each arr2[i] is in arr1.
