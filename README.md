# LeetCode

This is a repository that I use to commit my solutions for LeetCode problems. The repository is structured as follow:
```
ðŸ“¦ the repo
 â”£ðŸ“‚ <problem's number>-<problem's name>  # The problem's identifier, e.g. 0001-two-sum
 â”ƒ â”£ðŸ“œ PROBLEM.md                         # The problem description
 â”ƒ â”£ðŸ“œ SOLUTIONS.md                       # The explanation for my solutions
 â”ƒ â”£ðŸ“‚ <solution 1>                       # The folder containing source code for the first solution, e.g. use-map
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ðŸ“œ <solution 1>.py                  # Python code for the solution (if any).
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”—ðŸ“œ <solution 1>.cpp                 # C++ code for the solution (if any).
 â”ƒ â”—ðŸ“‚ <more solutions ...>               # More solutions for the problem (if any).
 â”—ðŸ“‚ <more problems ...>                  # Other problems
```
